# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** (v7.0.0 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (for database-dependent projects)
- **Git**

### Setting Up Individual Projects

Each project may have different setup requirements. Common patterns:

#### React/Vite Projects (NeuralMate, DEV_LENS, CHESS, etc.)
```bash
cd [PROJECT_NAME]
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend Projects
```bash
cd backend/[SPECIFIC_PROJECT]
npm install
# Create .env file if needed
npm start
```

#### Static Projects
Simply open `index.html` in your browser or use a live server.

### Environment Variables

Some projects require environment variables. Check individual project directories for `.env.example` files and create your own `.env` files as needed.
