## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Standards

- **ES6+ Features**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Functional Components**: Prefer functional components with hooks
- **Destructuring**: Use destructuring for props and state
- **Arrow Functions**: Use arrow functions for consistency
- **Const/Let**: Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

#### Example:
```javascript
// ✅ Good
const UserCard = ({ user, onEdit }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  
  const handleEdit = () => {
    setIsEditing(true);
    onEdit(user.id);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="user-card">
      <h3>{user.name}</h3>
      <button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// ❌ Avoid
class UserCard extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isEditing: false };
  }
  // ...
}
```

### CSS/Styling Standards

- **TailwindCSS**: Use Tailwind utilities when available
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Semantic Classes**: Use meaningful class names
- **Consistent Spacing**: Follow existing spacing patterns

#### Example:
```css
/* ✅ Good */
.button-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200;
}

/* ❌ Avoid */
.btn {
  background: #3b82f6;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px 16px;
}
```

### File Organization

- **Components**: Use PascalCase for component files
- **Utilities**: Use camelCase for utility files
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Folders**: Use kebab-case for folder names

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UserCard/
│   │   ├── UserCard.jsx
│   │   ├── UserCard.css
│   │   └── index.js
├── utils/
│   ├── apiHelpers.js
│   └── validation.js
├── constants/
│   └── API_ENDPOINTS.js
```

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
