## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our projects, please help us maintain a secure environment by reporting it responsibly.

### üîí Private Disclosure

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these methods:

#### Method 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/H0NEYP0T-466/WEB_DEV_PRATICE/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form

#### Method 2: Email
Send an email to: **security@h0neyp0t-466.dev** (if available)

#### Method 3: GitHub Issues (For non-critical issues only)
For less critical security concerns, you may create a private issue by contacting the maintainers directly.
